====================

## Introduction

  This library provides a set of Monad transformers (and instances for common transformers) on top of 
  widget switching primitives for reflex. For example ReaderT and WriterT which operate in the presence 
  of widget switching, allowing you to pass inputs and outputs up and down the UI tree.
